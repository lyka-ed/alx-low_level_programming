**0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**
This project is aimed at learning more about nested loops in **C Programming**

## Technologies Used
* Betty coding style 
* Files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* vim editor

## Files
The following fies are written in C:
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-isupper` | Checks for uppercase character |
| `1-isdigit` | Checks for a digit (0 through 9) |
| `2-mul` | Function that multiplies two integers |
| `3-print_numbers` | Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line |
| `4-print_most_numbers` | Prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, do not print 2 and 4 |
| `5-more_numbers` | Prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line |
| `6-print_line` | Function that draws a straight line in the terminal |
| `7-print_diagonal` | Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal |
| `8-print_square` | Function that prints a square, followed by a new line |
| `9-fizz_buzz` | Prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz |
| `10-print_triangle` | Function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line |
